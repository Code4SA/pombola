Please see [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) file

## Future

The Pombola codebase was originally written for the Kenyan site
[mzalendo.com](http://info.mzalendo.com). It has since been modified to support
other sites around the world, notably several in Africa.

We want the code to be easy to use for other installations, but currently there are some rough edges.
